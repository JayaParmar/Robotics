# Robotics
This repository includes my project work on complete design, analysis and simulation of a 4 link real world KUKA manipulator robot. The project includes the free body diagram; kinematics and dynamics calculations; selection of sensors and actuators; control model and path planning of our robot in Matlab and solid works. It is a part of my Masters study in Automation.
